QA Plan
=======

Overview
--------

We plan to automate as much of the testing as possible to avoid human error and to allow us to test more often.
We will be using Travis-CI to run our test suite every time code is checked in.
The build status will be visible on Travis' website as well as in the README on our GitHub page.
We will also keep track of our test suite's coverage of our code, based on lines executed during testing.
We will be using the tool coverage along with the software as a service provided by coveralls.io.
Our code coverage will be visible on coveralls.io as well as in the README on our GitHub page.

For non-code artifacts, we must consider how to ensure the quality of all documents produced.
For each piece of documentation produced for the project, we will have a primary and secondary writing assignee.
Who is assigned for each document is based on the roles we have each selected.
The duty of the primary assignee is to make sure that the document is thorough where necesary, concise where possible, and completed on time.
After this time, it is the duty of the secondary assignee is to review the document thoroughly.
The reviewer should eliminate typos, make grammar corrections, clarify vague sections, and gaurentee the completeness of the document.
After the initial completion of the document, the secondary assignee will have one week or until the project is due, whichever is less, to complete the review.

While we do have clear roles determining who is responsible for quality control at each step of the process, we also hope to have a culture in which any member of the team feels comfortable stepping in at any point and improving our artifacts.
Our rule is that any member can contribute to any part of the project at any time, however, there is always a member who's duty it is to make sure that part is finished on time.
